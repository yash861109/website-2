<h1>The Chicago Bulls</h1>
<p>The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago. The Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division.[9] The team was founded on January 16, 1966, and played its first game during the 1966–67 NBA season.[1] The Bulls play their home games at the United Centre, an arena on Chicago's West Side.</p>
<h1>The Road To A Championship</h1>

<p>The Bulls saw their greatest success during the 1990s when they played a major part in popularising the NBA worldwide. They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats. All six of their championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and coach Phil Jackson. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships while never losing an NBA Finals series in their history.[10]

The Bulls won 72 games during the 1995–96 season, setting an NBA record that stood until the Golden State Warriors won 73 games during the 2015–16 season. The Bulls were the first team in NBA history to win 70 games or more in a single season, and the only NBA franchise to do so until the 2015–16 Warriors.[11]</p>


    
     <h1>The Players That Lead The Bulls To A Championship</h1>
     <p>Steve Kerr joined the Bulls for the 1993-94 season but didn't play with Michael Jordan until MJ's comeback in the 1994-95 season. Kerr was a knockdown shooter similar to the players above and below him — the only difference being that Kerr has a legit claim to being the most accurate shooter of all time. Kerr hit a remarkable 47.9% of his 3-point shots as a member of the Bulls and 38.6% over five different postseasons with Chicago. 

He gained MJ's trust over several seasons, leading to Kerr's game-winning shot in the 1997 NBA Finals. Michael Jordan racked up six NBA titles over a long and successful career, and despite his individual dominance, he wouldn't have won as much as he did without the help of countless great teammates. For all of MJ's six titles, Phil Jackson was the head coach, pulling the strings and pressing the right buttons to maximum performance out of a constantly changing array of personalities. Dennis Rodman was clearly going to be in the top-three on this list and it felt right to have him at No. 2. Rodman spent only three seasons as Michael Jordan's teammate but played dominating basketball in each of those seasons. 

Rodman helped those Bulls teams function at a ridiculously high-level with his almost obsessive, singular focus on defence and rebounding. In the 1995-96 playoffs, The Worm averaged 7.5 points and 13.7 rebounds and helped the Bulls deal with the likes of Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal and Shawn Kemp on their way to their fourth NBA title.  Scottie Pippen is without a doubt the best player Michael Jordan has ever played with. Pip is a Hall-of-Famer and in 1996 was a part of the NBA's "50 Greatest Players in NBA History" list, though he was still an active player.

Pippen was a dominant playmaking forward on offence and a suffocating one-on-one and team defender, literally the perfect complement to MJ in every way. The 1991 NBA Finals were Pippen's coming out party, as he averaged 20.8 points, 9.4 rebounds, 6.6 assists, 2.4 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. He was a primary factor in slowing down Magic Johnson and aiding MJ in winning his first NBA title. Jordan was obviously a dominant force who was going to win championships at some point in his career, but if the Bulls don't acquire Pippen in 1987, MJ's legacy looks very, very different.</p>
